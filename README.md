# Jeu-de-Nim : PvP
- Nim is a mathematical game. There are N number of rows, and each row has M number of pawns. 
- Each turn, a player choose a row and take out a number (1 to M) of pawns.
- The winner is the one who take out the last pawn(s).

Program: The program displays the number of pawns in each row, asks the first player the number
of the row from which he/she wishes to remove pawns and the number of pawns to be removed. The 
program then updates the number of pawns in the heap and displays the new heap. It then questions
the second player, asks the same questions, and so on until a winner is announced.
